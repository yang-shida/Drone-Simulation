# Drone-Simulation
- Check out my demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1pniDwU6E&t=9m30s)
  - The link skips the first half of my presentation and goes directly to the full animation
- Use OpenGL and multi-threading to simulate a drone show in C++.
- Simulation content
  - Stay on the ground for 5 seconds
  - Fly towards a virtual sphere
  - Move on the surface of the virtual sphere with random initial velocity for 60 seconds
  - Collision between drones are elastic
- Physical constrains
  - Gravity: 9.8 m/s^2
  - Drone mass: 1 kg
  - Drone max output force: 20 N
